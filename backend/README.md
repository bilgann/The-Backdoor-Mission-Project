 # Backdoor Mission - Backend

 Run the backend with Python from the project root or from the `backend` folder.

 - From repository root (recommended):

 ```
 python backend\app.py
 ```

 - From inside the `backend` folder:

 ```
 python app.py
 ```

 Note: do not run `cd backend ; python app.py` if you're already inside the `backend` folder — that will attempt to `cd` into a non-existent `backend\backend` directory and PowerShell will error.

 For Windows users you can also run the `start-backend.ps1` script from the repository root.
